# Mbed CE Hello World using Batch/bash files with Eclipse tutorial
This project implements a basic hello world using Mbed OS Community Edition.  Use it as an example or a starting place for your own projects!
Use the batch or bash file to compile. You need to change the project name inside the CMakeList.txt file. Under /src you can put your project files.

## To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone it to your machine.  Don't forget to use `--recursive` to clone the submodules: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/MariwanJ/mbed-ce-hello-world `
2. You may want to update the mbed-os submodule to the latest version, with `cd mbed-os && git pull origin master`
3. Set up the GNU ARM toolchain (and other programs) on your machine using [the toolchain setup guide](https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/Toolchain-Setup-Guide).
4. Set up the CMake project for editing.  We have three ways to do this:
    - On the [command line](https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/Project-Setup:-Command-Line)
    - Using the [CLion IDE](https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/Project-Setup:-CLion)
    - Using the [VS Code IDE](https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/Project-Setup:-VS-Code)
5. Build the `flash-HelloWorld` target to upload the code to a connected device.
6. Batch or Bash files uses 20 threads for compiling source code. Increase or decrease that as you wish (-j 20)

## This Version: 

I have made some changes to the file structure. Now, your project files should be placed inside the '/src' folder instead of the root directory. In my opinion, project files shouldn't be located directly in the root.

Additionally, I have included a PDF document that provides instructions for configuring Eclipse to compile and debug your project. By using OpenOCD, the binary file will be automatically uploaded when you start debugging. Alternatively, you can manually copy the bin file into the virtual Nucleo flash memory, which will install the binary inside the Nucleo module. Another option is to use the stm32 utility to upload the project.

Please note that I don't have access to other boards or modules. Feel free to update this readme and contribute to this version in order to make it more general.

Mbed studio, or Visual studio code, IMHO, is not a proper IDE for debugging mbed projects. Feel free to contribute to this copy or the original. 

## Notes:
- Inside your cpp file under /src do not use #include <balbla.h> , you should write the include with quotation marks .i.e. #include "balbla.h".
- You must include the libraries you use in the cmake file. I updated the cmake file and put place and note how to do so. Look at the documentations also here https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/MbedOS-configuration#configuration-via-cmake-files
- The PDF shows you how to configure Eclipse for debugging and for compiling. Please notice that the pictures inside the pdf is for a project based on NUCLEO-F207ZG. Try to change the names, script files..etc. to your HW. OpeOCD scritp could be either written or found on the net if you cannot find it. I made the script for F2X. Board by myself. OpenOCD doesnâ€™t provide that by default.
